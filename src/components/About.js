            <p>
                I am a San Diego based web developer based in
                Clairemont. I am pivoting from a previous career in
                facilities management. As a recent graduate of a full stack
                web development boot camp, I am hoping to take the skills I have
                learned over the past few months and improve on them through
                practical applications and work in a professional environment.
            </p>
